# Anagramme

This game is essentially done with QML C ++ and javascript and uses several modules of Qt.Quick 2.7 and Qt 5.8 so it is more than necessary to have Qt up to date. It is compiled with MinGw 4.9 but because of its simplicity, I would say that it will compile with any version of MinGw more or less recent
